        ## Installation
        * Install Homebrew (http://brew.sh)

        `brew install figlet && brew install lolcat`

        * Run **Zoom-CLI-py**
        
        ## Usage
        * #Zoom-CLI is too long to type every time you want to join a meeting quickly, so instead run `zcli`
        	* To add meetings to your list run:
        	 `zcli add [name] [code] [password]`
        	* To delete any saved meeting run:
        	 `zcli delete [name]`
        	* To start a meeting you have added to your list run:
        	 `zcli [name]`
        	* To list your saved meetings run:
        	 `zcli list`
        	* To see the path to your .zcli file run:
        	 `zcli path`
        	* For additional help run:
        	 `zcli --help`
